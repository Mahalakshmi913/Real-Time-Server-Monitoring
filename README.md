# Real-Time Server Monitoring and Performance Optimization

## Project Overview
XYZ Corporation operates a distributed cloud infrastructure with numerous virtual servers hosting business-critical applications. Monitoring server performance, detecting anomalies, and proactively managing resources is challenging due to limited real-time insights.

This project implements an **end-to-end data pipeline** for real-time server monitoring, performance optimization, and proactive issue resolution.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Server Monitoring**: Continuously collects performance metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual server behavior using threshold-based and statistical methods.  
- **Resource Optimization**: Provides insights to optimize server resources and prevent over-provisioning.  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays server performance dashboards in Power BI.  

---

## Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects server performance metrics using Azure Databricks and cloud monitoring APIs.  
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans, transforms, and aggregates server metrics for analysis.  
3. **Storage**: Stores processed data in a cloud database or data lake for scalability.  
4. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboards provide interactive visualizations of server health, performance trends, and anomalies.
